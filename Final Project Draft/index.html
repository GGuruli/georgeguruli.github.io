																	The treatment of Native Americans by the United Statesâ€™ government is a contentious topic to this day, and for very good reasons. With horrific events like the Trail of Tears and forcing these people of their land, many people living in the United States are still feeling the effects of their forced migration. 
																</p>
																<p>
																Going back to look over how the Native Americans were treated when the United States was formed gives many interesting details. This is especially the case when one takes into account George Washington and the government that he presided over following the Revolutionary War. The first president of the United States is an interesting figure, as he has been practically deified by the country he helped form, but looking into Washington and his government creates an interesting picture. This is especially true for how they interacted with the Native Americans. It is the goal of this website to give some information on how the Native Americans were treated by Washington and his government, and how certain events came to be at the time.
