												<h2>Early Life</h2>

												<p>
													The earliest parts of George Washington’s life are quite easy to discover, so in the hopes of not boring those reading, this will be rather brief. George Washington was born February 22nd, 1732, in Popes Creek, Virginia to Augustine and Mary Ball Washington. At the time, anybody born in the English Colonies would become the subjects of the king. The Washington family was quite a wealthy one, having made money in land speculation, according to the book <em>Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence</em> by Harlow Giles Unger. Washington was well-educated, and his education would include land speculation, a subject that would perhaps be expected considering his family’s use of it to obtain their wealth. Washington was known for writing well, even if his writing wasn’t particularly witty or personable, and he was determined to advance in society by any means he could. 
It’s worth noting as well that Washington had multiple siblings, including an older half-brother named Lawrence Washington. Lawrence died of tuberculosis in 1752, with his wife dying in 1761. Their deaths meant that George inherited Mount Vernon, the place where he would live out his final days. 
Washington would actually encounter the Native Americans in 1748. Writing in his journal, Washington’s thoughts on the Native Americans at the time were not unique, considering them to be “savages” who were not as civilized or intelligent as the colonists. Anybody who studies on the Native Americans and how the colonists viewed them has most likely heard these talking points before, and these views have terrible consequences for the Native Americans later on. Keep this in mind for later on.

												<h3>French and Indian War</h3>
												<p>
													The French and Indian War took place from 1754 to 1763. Washington would fight for the British in this war as a member of the Virginia Militia, where he would have many encounters with the Native Americans. Over these encounters, Washington would develop a respect of the “savages”, in particular their tactics and ability to overwhelm Washington and the colonists. Washington would continue to attack the Native Americans who sided with the British and tried to prevent colonist expansion.
												</p>
												<p>
												Excuse the brief note, but there are two things about the above that I think should be kept in mind. The first is Washington’s experience and schooling in land speculation. The second is how he continued to fight against the Native Americans even while he acknowledged his previous misconceptions about them.

<h2>President of the United States</h2>
<p>I could go over the Revolutionary War and how the Native Americans factor into it, but that’s what the other page is for. Washington himself is well known for his contributions to the war effort, and it all lead to him becoming the first President of the United States on April 30, 1789. As the first president, Washington would have to decipher what to do about the Native Americans, especially since many of them fought on the side of the British. There are different interpretations of Washington and his interactions with the Native Americans, but I’ll try and narrow it down into two categories.</p>
<h3>Land Speculator</h3>
<p>This is a rather cynical interpretation of Washington, though not one without merit. As noted above, Washington’s family gained their wealth in land speculation, and Washington himself wasn’t a stranger to obtaining land in similar fashion. Historian Fred Anderson argues that because Washington himself was a land speculator, he dismissed actually allying with the Native Americans because he wanted to take their land for himself. This would actually place some of his later actions in a darker light when one considers the “civilization” ideas that Washington himself would agree with. Historian Theda Perdue argues that Washington would want the teach the Native Americans to become “civilized” because he wanted to teach them the idea that land is a commodity, and in doing so the United States would be able to buy their land from them. Perdue also theorizes that Washington, like many people in the United States, was against the Native Americans because of how different their lifestyle was from his own, the example cited being how women did most of the agricultural labor and sold the produce of said labor themselves, this obviously being the complete opposite of the male-dominated culture that the United States had adopted. As Perdue states:</p>
<q>“Native People had to recognize and appreciate land as a commodity to be bought and sold”.</q>
<p>This is something of an easy idea to buy. After all, the idea of pushing away the Native Americans in order to obtain their land was a widespread ideal in the United States. Just look at the settlers and frontiers at the time, and the limits they were willing to push in order to obtain land. For my own opinion, while Washington could have obviously had selfish reasons for what he did, I think there was another factor to take into account.</p>
<h3>Miguided Beliefs</h3>
<p>This next one is perhaps one that many would find to be a bit too sympathetic of Washington. The idea here is that Washington genuinely believed that he was helping the Native Americans in trying to “civilize” them. Keep in mind that Washington, while he was admired, could not dictate the beliefs of his citizens. Land settlers were looking to take the Native Americans’ land by force, and they would do so even if they had to attack and even kill the Native Americans. 
Washington himself did not want to fight the Native Americans, mainly because of how fragile the United States was at the time. They didn’t have enough money to fight in an extended war with the Native Americans, and even if they did, it would cost many lives on both sides. He also agreed with his Secretary of War, Henry Knox, that the settlers were just as much to blame for the violent encounters with the Native Americans as the Native Americans themselves were. Indeed, by 1796, Washington was frustrated by the settlers and their constant attempts to force the Native Americans off their land, as he states to in a letter to Timothy Pickering:</p>
<q>“I believe scarcely anything short of a Chinese wall, or a line of troops, will restrain Land jobbers, and the encroachment of settlers upon the Indian Territory.”</q>
<q>Washington probably believed that his plan to “civilize” the Native Americans was one born of understanding. He did attempt to make treaties with the Native Americans that had them keep their land, in particular a treaty with Creeks’ leader Alexander McGillivray.  McGillivray would sign the Treaty of New York in 1790 with Henry Knox and Washington, which came as a result of discussions that he and twenty-eight Creek chiefs had with the two men during the summer of 1790. The treaty had the Creeks agree to place themselves under the protection of the United States. The United States would then acknowledge land as being owned by the Creeks and thus prevent settlers and such frontiers from attacking the tribe to claim the land themselves.
Would I say that Washington was basically forced to allow these settlers to continue their attacks? Not exactly. While I don’t believe Washington wanted to forcibly remove the Indians from their land, I do think that he did have prejudice against them for one reason or another. It’s hard to determine what Washington would do if he had more resources, but I believe that he would have continued to try and “civilize” the Native Americans even without the threat of the settlers. Having said that, I don’t believe he would have resorted to overt force, if only because he was conscious of the lives that would be lost on both sides.</q>

												<h3>Washington’s Failure</h3>
												<p>
													The fact that more conflicts with the Native Americans should probably tell you how successful Washington was in terms of keeping the settlers away. I don’t envy his position here, and while it’s easy to look back at the past and criticize the failures of it, Washington was only really part of the problem. He couldn’t stop the settlers because he didn’t have the resources to do so, and even if he could, it’s debatable what he would do to the Native Americans considering his history as a land speculator. One would hope that Washington could have negotiated peacefully with the Native Americans and respect their wishes, especially considering the fact that the United States was founded in opposition to a nation trying to enforce their will on unwilling subjects. Whatever the case, the First President was unable to protect the Native Americans, and his belief in “civilizing” the Native Americans only caused more pain for them.
