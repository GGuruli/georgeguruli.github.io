												<p>
													It wouldn’t be a surprise for anyone to hear that the Native Americans and the colonists were on bad terms even before war broke out. Considering that the colonists were forcing their way through Native American land and saw them as “uncivilized”, it shouldn’t be a surprise that the Native Americans didn’t take their violence lying down. Indeed, while people on both sides were looking for more peaceful options, this thread of violence and hatred would have poor consequences for all those involved.
												</p>
												<p>To put things into perspective, there were around 200,000 Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River, with at least 85 different nations between them. At first, many of them wanted to stay out of the conflict, not wanting to be caught up in affairs that didn’t concern them.</p>
												<q>“We are unwilling to join on either side… for we love you both-old England and new.”</q>
												<p>Both the British and the Colonists were initially planning to respect their decision. Even beyond the grievances either side had with the Native Americans, they were seen as “expensive and unpredictable”. It seemed, however, that both sides realized that the Native Americans could easily be a dangerous ally to the other side, and decided to try and ally with them. <br> The British were actually able to gain many Native American allies with promises of trading goods, not to mention actually having good will with the Native Americans previously because they fought back against the encroachments of Native American land that the Colonists pushed for. 
Only Indians in small enclaves that were located on colonial settlements joined the colonists, but it didn’t really compare to the amount of Native Americans who fought for the British. An estimated 13,000 Native American men fought against the colonists for the British during the Revolutionary War. Tribes such as the Delawares, Shawnees, Cherokee, and Iroquois attacked the Colonists. The Cherokee attacked along the southern frontier in 1776. The Iroquois attacked New York and Pennsylvania in 1778. The Ohio River had an alliance of Indian Nations that used British supplies and troops to maintain control of the region.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Colonists fought back, invading Cherokee mountain homes in 1776 and 1780. Major General John Sullivan attacked the Iroquois in 1779. The Shawnees were pushed back in the Ohio country in 1780 and 1782. 
As one could expect, all of this would only make things worse, especially in the aftermath of the war itself.</p>
<h3>Treaty of Paris</h3>
<p>The Revolutionary War ended with The Treaty of Paris, which was signed on September 3, 1783. The Treaty said that the British had to cede all of the land east of the Mississippi River to the United States. The problem, as you’ll probably expect, is that none of The Native Americans agreed to this since none of their leaders were at the signing. Also keep in mind that the Native Americans thought that the war was still going strong in their favor, so being told that the war was lost and they had to give up their land was not something that won the United States or the British any love.</p>
<q>“If it was really true that the English had basely betrayed them by pretending to give up their Country to the Americans without their consent, or consulting them, it was an Act of Cruelty and Injustice that Christians only were capable of doing,”</q>	
<p>Later on in 1783, Congress sent commissioners to the Native Americans with something called Theory of Conquest, which came from the treaty. The Theory of Conquest stated that because the British were defeated, the Native Americans were defeated as well due to being their allies, and the United States was entitled to their land because of this. The reasons that the United States wanted the land so desperately can be found on another page, but the gist of it is that the federal government needed money after the war.</p>
<h3>Rights of Land</h3>										
<p>There were many attempts by the United States to dictate treaties to the Native Americans, especially from 1784 to 1786, but those treaties were considered null by the Native Americans because of the circumstances. Many Native American leaders also stated that the land they owned was theirs, especially because they had signed treaties with the British prior to the Revolutionary War that agreed with these terms. It also didn’t hurt, for the Native Americans, that Spanish and British forces, which were located in Florida and the Old Northwest respectively, continued to send supplies for Native American resistance. Leaders such as the Mohawk tribe Joseph Brank and the Creek tribe Alexander McGillivray were also a boon for the Native Americans, as they were able to lead them effectively against the United States.
For whatever it’s worth, there were people in the United States who agreed that the Native Americans owned their land, in particular Secretary of War Henry Knox and even George Washington himself. It’s just that many other people, settlers and frontiers especially, believed that they deserved the land because they won the war, and the land was somehow vital to the continued success of the United States.</p>

												<h3>Right and Wrong</h3>
												<p>
												In my own opinion, the Native Americans were in the right here. It’s easy to say now, certainly, but the United States really does not come off as the good guys in this situation. They attempted to force people off the land that they lived on for generations, and used violence and threats to do so. It wasn’t until later on that they tried to use more peaceful methods, but even then there was an element of racism with how they wanted to “civilize” the Native Americans and force them to change their culture, which would have disastrous consequences down the line.
