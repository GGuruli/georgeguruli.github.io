												<h2>Issue of Land</h2>
												
											</header>

											<section>
												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<p>
													Anybody reading the other pages has probably gotten the sense that the land of the Native Americans plays a huge part in why so many colonists were encroaching on the Native Americans. But why would land be so important, especially since the United States didn’t seem to be in a position to obtain said land?
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Financial Issues</h3>
												<p>
													Following the victory of the Revolutionary War, the United States wasn’t in a strong position. The country had exhausted a lot of resources just to keep the war going, and were in danger of going bankrupt afterwards. Federal officials believed that more land was the answer, as they would be able to sell said land to soldiers or other spectators in order to raise money for the government. 
												</p>
												<h3>Conquest Theory</h3>
												<p>As noted on the Revolutionary War page, the United States believed that they had earned the land because they defeated the British. Conquest Theory was the idea that because the British were defeated, the Native Americans were defeated as well, and as such they had to give up their land even if they hadn’t agreed to do so. The racist ideologies that the United States had against the Native Americans also comes into play here, believing that the “savages” were not able to see what value their land actually had. Washington himself seemed to believe that the Native Americans needed to be taught what value their land held, as if they couldn’t understand why the United States was constantly trying to force them off their land.</p>
												<h3>Settlers and Frontiers</h3>
												<p>You’ve probably seen mentions of these people in other pages, and for good reason. As noted above, the land of the Native Americans was desired by the federal government because they believed that they could sell the land and pull themselves out of bankruptcy. As such, many settlers and frontiers arrived in the United States, hoping to obtain the land of the Native Americans by any means necessary. However, problems would arise in other ways beyond the Native Americans.</p>
                                                <h3>Federal Policy</h3>
<p>By the mid-1780s, many federal officials realized that going to war with the Native Americans simply wasn’t worth it, and they decided to find some other way to obtain the land. There were plans that they formed to make laws to have more peaceful interactions with the Native Americans. The early 1790s saw a national policy that respected the Native Americans’ right to their land, and that those lands can only be acquired by the United States through treaties approved by the Senate. This all comes with the idea of “civilizing” the Native Americans. </p>
<h3>Violence Continues</h3>
<p>Despite federal policy, however, the settlers decided to oppose it violently. They wanted to expand their land and didn’t care about the Native Americans or their rights, and so they believed that if they continuously attacked the Native Americans, the United States would eventually be forced to war. Local governments actually supported this, as many officials on a state level desired the Native American land and weren’t particularly bothered by the idea of the Native Americans being forced said land. The Native Americans, for their part, actually knew that the frontier people were not representative of the federal government, as Cherokee Leaders told Federal Agents:</p>
<q>“We think that the United States do not want our lands, but we know as well who do want them-the frontier people want them”.</q>
<p>Another reason for this is that each colony was able to handle the Native Americans their own way, and were reluctant to follow the federal government and change whatever their previous policy was. A problem of pride could explain why so many were so willing to ignore the federal government, even in subtle ways.</p>												
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>Consequences</h3>
												<p>
													It can be said that many people were unable to actually decipher what to do about the Native Americans, and that they resorted to violence because they were able to before. To that, I would say that they still had dire consequences that they seemingly refused to acknowledge. The federal government was at least capable of seeing that their needed to be change, and that their methods were not working, but people didn’t see it that way. Citizens of the United States only saw the land as being wasted, even if said land belonged to other people by right. 
												</p>
												<p>
													I don’t think they really deserve to be given the benefit of the doubt here. They knew that what they were doing was only going to cause more suffering, and they still continued. The constant mistreatment of the Native Americans continues to be a horrible part of the legacy of the United States, and the settlers and frontier only form a dark part of said legacy.
