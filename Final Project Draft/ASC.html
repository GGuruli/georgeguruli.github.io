												<h2>The Governor Opposing the Native Americans</h2>

													A man born in Scotland on March 23, 1737, Arthur St. Clair stands as one of the people opposed to the likes of George Washington and Henry Knox in terms of what to do about the Native Americans. As he wrote to Knox in June of 1789 “The savages should be brought to peace, either by treaty, or by force”. Along with this, he served as the governor of the Northwest Territory, which was formed by the Northwest Ordinance. St. Clair didn’t believe that the Native Americans could be convinced to give up their land, and thus, he fought in the Northwest Indian War.

												<h3>Battle of the Wabash</h3>
												<p>
												Arthur St. Clair was a General in the War, and he led 1,000 men in a battle near the Wabash River in the Northwest Ordinance on November 4, 1791. The Miami, Shawnee, and Delaware tribes fought his force viciously, and ultimately defeated St. Clair’s force to the point that only 24 of the original 1,000 men left the battle unharmed. 
												</p>
												<p>As one would imagine, this did not leave St. Clair in a favorable position with Washington. The President forced him to resign, and the battle is considered one of the greatest military defeats of the United States army. It could represent the value of what St. Clair believed in, depending on how you look at it.</p>

												<h3>Fear of the Native Americans</h3>
												<p>
												It can be dangerous to look upon figures of the past and try to narrow them down or simplify them. These were real people, and it is important to remember that they were born in a different time. Having said that, I don’t want to give the impression that these people cannot be judged for their actions. People like Arthur St. Clair only made a bad situation worse, not only for the Native Americans, but for his own people.
