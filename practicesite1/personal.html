<h1>My Life And Where I Want To Go</h1>
<article>
<p>I would be lying if I said that I considered my life to be unique or special. I have two older sisters, and we all live comfortably because of my parents' hard work. My family are immigrants from the Republic of Georgia, having moved to the United States a few years before I was born. My parents always wanted great things for me, and they always tried to make me study hard in order to be successful. I wish I could say that I always followed their advice, but as a child and a teenager I struggled to be the son that I wanted to be, and it wouldn't be until college that I understood why.<br> During my sophomore year at George Mason University, I learned that I had depression and untreated ADD. I took a semester off in order to get the therapy I needed for both conditions, and came back to college more prepared then ever. With a clearer mind and more determined than ever, I started doing much better in all of my classes, finally achieving the grades that I wanted. I became more invested in my major, and through my desire to learn more about writing, I took a minor in the subject to learn topics that I never would have otherwise. All of which has made me wonder aboutmy future, and the type of job that I would like to take. I know that I enjoy writing and researching, and I want to see what sort of work I can get that involves both of those skills.<br> As I've said before, I don't find myself to be particularly unique. However, I do think that I have skills that would work in many fields, and I want the opportunity to use my abilities to help others. I hope that what I have here is sufficent for others to see what I have to offer.</p>
