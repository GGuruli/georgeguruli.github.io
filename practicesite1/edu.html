<h1>College Experiences</h1>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Classes at George Mason University have taught me much about many different subjects, but history and writing have been the subjects that held my interest. The different classes I've taken have shown me much about what it takes to be informed and studious, whether in college or outside of it.</p>
<h3>HISTORY 125</h3>
<p>A basic class, one that practically everyone at George Mason has to attend, but I find that even the simplest of classes can teach you fundamental skills for the future.<br> <strong>HISTORY 125</strong> teaches students about the history of the Western world, and how many concepts that we take as a part of everyday life have their origins in places we don't think about. For what is considered a standard class, <strong>HISTORY 125</strong> teaches students how to properly absorb and work through a vast amount of information, and how tied together much of the world is. For a History major, it is certainly an important step forward.</p>
<h3>HISTORY 300</h3>
<p>Another important History class, <strong>HISTORY 300</strong> is one of the most difficult classes in the major, and for good reason. While the subject of the classes differ, the core experience remains the same. The goal of the class is to teach students how to properly write a research paper, using and properly citing primary sources in order to do so.<br> My own <strong>HISTORY 300</strong> class was focused on George Mason University itself. I had to go to many of the physical archives at the <i>Fenwick Library</i> to complete my research. My topic was focused on the <em>Upward Bound</em> program, which was formed in 1965 to aid students who didn't have the finances to attend higher level education. I went through countless documents on the subject to learn about how the <em>Upward Bound</em> program was recieved at George Mason, and I discovered many aspects about the university, not only about the student population, but the educators who had to work through the process of implementing the program.<br> The class taught me much about research and the more difficult aspects of it, which would aid me in many future classes, especially in history.</p>
<h3>HISTORY 499</h3>
<p>In many ways, this is the class where everything we learned about history is put to the test. The easiest way to explain <strong>HISTORY 499</strong> is that it's an even more difficult version of <strong>HISTORY 300</strong>. We have to utilize primary sources, secondary sources, and scholarly articles in order to compile the information necessary for our final paper, which was required to be over twenty pages long. That's before one takes into account the use of footnotes and proper sourcing, which meant that we had to constantly take notes as we read through books and articles to find everything we needed.<br> As the class was focused on early American history, we had a large range of topics to choose from. I decided to research the first Secretary of War, Henry Knox, and how he handled the Native Americans after the Revolutionary War. As there aren't many sources on Knox himself, I had to research many different figures from the time, including George Washington.<br> Doing so taught me how to connect many events together into a cohesive paper, and how to discover information from unlikely sources. I also learned how to properly cite my sources, which is helpful regardless of subject.</p>
<h3>ENGLISH 386</h3>
<p>A class focused on editing not only my own writing, but the professional writing of others. <strong>ENGLISH 386</strong> teaches students how to properly edit and work through papers and websites in order to correct not only spelling errors, but the overall voice of the content. I've learned how to do research into unfamiliar topics, and how to properly edit documents so that the subjects of those documents are easier to understand for a wider audience.</p> 
<h3>ENGLISH 388</h3>
<p>This is the class where I learned how to expand my writing skills. <strong>ENGLISH 388</strong> introduced me to the world of proposals, news articles, and reports.In essence, this class taught me how to write in different professional environments, and how I can correspond with others on different projects effectively.</p>
<h2>Experiences</h2>
<p>My experiences at George Mason have taught me much, but there is one aspect of it in particular that has helped me both in my professional and personal life.</p>
<h3>Living-Learning Community</h3>
<p>The <strong>Living-Learning Community</strong> is one that I lived in for two years, and I experienced so much in those two years that I don't believe I could have experienced anywhere else. The <strong>Living-Learning Community</strong> is one that teaches its students how to take of themselves both in mind and in body. While I initially didn't place much stock in this community, it only took a short time for me to see the effects that their advice had on me.<br> This community taught me how to take time away for myself. Even if I was stressed or needed to get an assignment done, it wasn't the end of the world if I failed. If I carefully planned out my days to include relaxation and work, I would be able to keep up with multiple classes while also taking care of myself mentally. Whether this be through meditation or taking the time to speak with friends and family, I realized how important it was to balance every aspect of my life without neglecting the advice of my teachers and fellow students. It's made me both work harder and smarter in all parts of my life.</p>
