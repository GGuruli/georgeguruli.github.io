<h1>Work Experiences</h1>
<section>
<h2>Children's Hospital of Richmond</h2>
<p>I worked here as a studen volunteer in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Both times I was tasked with aiding the nurses and creating entertainment for the patients. My experiences here resulted in me learning how to properly interact with my coworkers, and how to follow instructions and guidance to the best of my ability, even in a field that I was unsure of.</p>

<h2>Robert Hannessey Farm</h2>
<p>A job that I took up after my first year in college in 2016, this farm was in Amherst, Massachusetts. I had to work from the early morning until the later afternoon. I performed chores around the farm, including feeding, watering, and grazing the animals while also taking care of the equipment around the farm. I was also placed in charge of the farm for two weeks while my employer had to take a business trip. I learned the value of hard work, and how to properly manage a schedule for many different aspects of a job so as to not get overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>National Youth Leadership Forum: Law & CSI</h2>
<p>A Future Leader Trainee program that I was selected for in Washington, DC. From June to July of 2015, I shadowed lawyers, judges, and police officers through criminal investigations, along with learning the themes, tools, and limitations of the criminal justice system. I also attended coursework on compiling evidence, building a theory of a case, and courtroom strategy and communication. This all lead to a trial simulation that I took part in, taking the role of one of the Supreme Court Justices.<br> An experience that showed me the details of the criminal justice system, and how to properly round up evidence in whatever I was working on, something that would serve me well in college.</p>
