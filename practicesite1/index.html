<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<img src="picture.jpg" alt="Picture of Me" style="width:200px;height:200px;" class="rotate90">
<p>I'm a twenty two year old sernior student at George Mason University. I am completing a major in <strong>History</strong> while also working on a minor in <strong>Professional Writing</strong>.<br> I've always had an interest in researching the past and the different interpretations that arise from people studying it. I've developed an appreaciation for writing as well, and in doing so I have been trying to improve my writing in any way that I can. While I still have a lot to learn, my experiences have taught me much about the world and what I have to offer.</p>
